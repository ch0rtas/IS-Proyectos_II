Operators Precedence\n","If there is more than one operator in an expression, it may give different results on basis of the order of operators executed. To sort out these confusions, the operator precedence is defined. Operator Precedence simply defines the priority of operators that which operator is to be executed first. Here we see the operator precedence in Python, where the operator higher in the list has more precedence or priority:\n","\n","![Image](ImagesNotebook1/Precedence.JPG)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1c8b5346","metadata":{"id":"1c8b5346","outputId":"1472f546-9e8f-4c9a-becf-f9474d150e87"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["a:20 b:10 c:15 d:5\n"]}],"source":["a = 20\n","b = 10\n","c = 15\n","d = 5\n","\n","print (\"a:%d b:%d c:%d d:%d\" % (a,b,c,d ))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f81e6b31","metadata":{"id":"f81e6b31","outputId":"4f777768-0166-4ded-bdd2-4a6d318bed2b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Value of a + b * c / d is  50.0\n"]}],"source":["e = a + b * c / d       # 20 + ( 10 * 15 ) / 5\n","print (\"Value of a + b * c / d is \",  e)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1000fe5c","metadata":{"id":"1000fe5c","outputId":"046bf2df-b9aa-413e-9666-a9f2f83cd1b7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Value of (a + b) * c / d is  90.0\n"]}],"source":["e = (a + b) * c / d       # (20 + 10) * 15  / 5\n","print (\"Value of (a + b) * c / d is \",  e)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"69e3ae6a","metadata":{"id":"69e3ae6a","outputId":"8703ea5d-3f63-444c-95b7-45b8dd9e9b95"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is  90.0\n"]}],"source":["e = ((a + b) * c) / d     # ((20 + 10) * 15 ) / 5\n","print (\"Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is \",  e)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"302f85d7","metadata":{"id":"302f85d7","outputId":"0d3630b1-b812-4cf2-fb36-c332effddbb6"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is  90.0\n"]}],"source":["e = (a + b) * (c / d)    # (20 + 10) * (15/5)\n","print (\"Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is \",  e)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"580bbcf0","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"580bbcf0","outputId":"bbe71d8f-32c2-40a4-c245-48193968d5e9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Value of a + (b * c) / d is  50.0\n"]}],"source":["e = a + (b * c) / d      #  20 + ( 10 * 15 ) / 5\n","print (\"Value of a + (b * c) / d is \",  e)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"12899d99","metadata":{"id":"12899d99"},"source":["# 4 Using Libraries\n","To make use of the functions in a module, you‚Äôll need to import the module with an import statement.  \n","An import statement is made up of the import keyword along with the name of the module"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"aae7cdc7","metadata":{"id":"aae7cdc7","outputId":"6657b5a1-931e-4726-e503-d5ff136f1b12"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["1.0\n"]}],"source":["import math\n","\n","x= math.sin(math.pi /2)\n","print(x)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"640c9364","metadata":{"id":"640c9364","outputId":"925316e5-9607-4c16-efcb-71c353167d4a"},"outputs":[{"ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'sin' is not defined","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[1;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[1;32m<ipython-input-3-f98927868f70>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[1;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m      1\u001b[0m \u001b[1;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mmath\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m----> 3\u001b[1;33m \u001b[0mx\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0msin\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mpi\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m/\u001b[0m\u001b[1;36m2\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[0;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mx\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[1;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'sin' is not defined"]}],"source":["import math\n","\n","x= sin(pi /2)\n","print(x)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d8207084","metadata":{"id":"d8207084"},"source":["## 4.1 Modifyting names\n","It is possible to modify the names of modules and their functions within Python by using the as keyword.    \n","\n","You may want to change a name because you have already used the same name for something else in your program, another module you have imported also uses that name, or you may want to abbreviate a longer name that you are using a lot.
